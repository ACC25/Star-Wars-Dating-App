# The Star Wars Dating App - Finding you love in a galaxy far, far away!

I came up with this idea to practice database setup, user authentication, authorization, and working with multiple APIs (Google and SWAPI) in the same project - while having some fun along the way. 

Users can select a set of gender, species and environmental criteria, and the app will query the database and select a random Star Wars character that fits those characteristics.
